# Random Color Generator

A simple React project that generates random colors in either RGB or HEX format. The user can switch between the two color formats and generate new random colors on demand. The background of the application updates with the generated color, and the current color code is displayed on the screen.

## Features

- Generate random RGB or HEX color codes.
- Dynamically update the background with the generated color.
- Display the selected color format (RGB or HEX) and its corresponding value.
- Buttons to switch between RGB and HEX modes and to generate new colors.

## React Concepts Used

- **useState**: To manage the state of the color and the color type (RGB/HEX).
- **useEffect**: To trigger color generation based on the selected color type.
- **Event handling**: Handling button click events to generate new colors and switch between RGB and HEX modes.
- **Conditional rendering**: To display the current color and format.
